## 📋 COMPLETED STAGES

### ✅ Stage 1: Roles Table + Clerk-Aware Helpers
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Execution Time:** ~2 minutes

**What was implemented:**
- Created `public.app_role` enum with 10 roles
- Created `public.user_roles` table with proper RLS
- Built `current_profile_id()` security definer function
- Built `has_role(_role)` security definer function
- Migrated existing roles from profiles table
- Set up admin role management policies

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.user_roles;
SELECT public.current_profile_id();
SELECT public.has_role('admin'::public.app_role);
```

---

### ✅ Stage 2: Lock Down Profiles PII
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Execution Time:** ~1 minute

**What was implemented:**
- Dropped permissive `profiles_select_public` policy
- Created `public_profiles` view (non-PII only)
- Created restrictive `profiles_select_owner_or_admin` policy
- Granted view access to anon and authenticated

**Verification:**
```sql
-- This should work (public info)
SELECT * FROM public.public_profiles;

-- This should only show YOUR profile (PII protected)
SELECT * FROM public.profiles WHERE clerk_id = auth.jwt()->>'sub';
```

---

- Secured tickets to booking owner or admin
- Fixed booking_tickets policies

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Test: Can only see your own bookings
SELECT * FROM public.bookings;

SELECT * FROM public.payments;

-- Test: Direct insert should fail
INSERT INTO public.payments (booking_id, amount_cents)

## 🧪 RECOMMENDED TESTING

### Security Testing Checklist

#### 1. Role-Based Access Testing
```bash
# Test as regular user
- [ ] Can access only own bookings
- [ ] Cannot access other users' payments
- [ ] Cannot see full profiles of other users
- [ ] Cannot directly insert payments
- [ ] Cannot modify roles

# Test as organizer
- [ ] Can see bookings for own events
- [ ] Can manage own events
- [ ] Cannot access other organizers' data

# Test as admin
- [ ] Can access all data (within RLS rules)
- [ ] Can manage user roles
- [ ] Can view platform fees
```

#### 2. Payment Flow Testing
```bash
# Test Stripe webhook
stripe listen --forward-to https://qydcfiufcoztzymedtbo.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook

# Create test payment
stripe payment_intents create \
  --amount=1000 \
  --currency=cop \
  --metadata[booking_id]=YOUR_BOOKING_ID

# Verify payment created in database
SELECT * FROM payments ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

#### 3. Profile & Role Testing
```bash
# Test user signup
- [ ] New user gets profile created

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### What's Protected Now
- ✅ All user PII (email, phone) restricted to owner/admin
- ✅ All payments webhook-only, immutable
- ✅ All roles stored in separate secure table
- ✅ All database functions have secure search_path
- ✅ All views respect RLS policies
- ✅ All tables have appropriate RLS policies

### What Still Needs Work
- 🔴 Testing infrastructure (0% complete)
- 🔴 Monitoring/alerting (10% complete)
- 🔴 Colombian payment methods (0% complete)
- 🔴 Spanish translations (0% complete)
- 🔴 Mobile optimization (20% complete)
- 🔴 Legal compliance (0% complete)

### Known Limitations
- Role changes require database update (no UI yet)
- Webhook signature verification is placeholder
- No retry logic for failed webhooks
- No rate limiting on edge functions
- No automated testing

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### Security Best Practices Applied
1. **Never store roles on user tables** - Use separate user_roles table
2. **Always use security definer functions** - For RLS policy checks
3. **Always set search_path** - Prevents privilege escalation
4. **Views need security_invoker** - To respect RLS
5. **Payments should be webhook-only** - Never allow direct inserts
6. **PII needs explicit protection** - Don't expose publicly

### Common Pitfalls Avoided
- ❌ Storing roles in profiles.role column (privilege escalation)
- ❌ Functions without search_path (security vulnerability)
- ❌ Views with security_definer (bypass RLS)
- ❌ Public read on PII tables (data exposure)
- ❌ Direct payment inserts (fraud risk)
- ❌ Mutable payments (audit trail compromise)
