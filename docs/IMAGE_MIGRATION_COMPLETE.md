# Image Assets Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully updated all image paths from `/src/assets/` to proper ES6 imports for production deployment.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Created Image Asset Management System
- **File**: `src/assets/index.ts` - Central image exports and URL mapping
- **File**: `src/hooks/useImageResolver.ts` - Hook for resolving database URLs to imports

### 2. Generated Production-Ready Images
- ✅ `hero-runway-new.jpg` - Main hero image (1920x1080)
- ✅ `hero-runway-production.jpg` - Backup hero image (1920x1080)
- ✅ `event-poster.jpg` - Event poster design (640x800)
- ✅ `designer-studio.jpg` - Original studio image
- ✅ `designer-studio-production.jpg` - Professional studio image (1200x800)
- ✅ `runway-1.jpg` through `runway-6.jpg` - Gallery images (1200x800)

### 3. Updated Components
- ✅ `EventHero.tsx` - Uses `useImageResolver` hook
- ✅ `EventCard.tsx` - Uses `useImageResolver` hook  
- ✅ `ImageGallery.tsx` - Uses `useImageResolver` hook for gallery and lightbox

### 4. Database Migration
- ✅ Updated all `/src/assets/` paths to production paths (`/image-name.jpg`)
- ✅ Added gallery images for all events (15+ new gallery images)
- ✅ Maintained proper display ordering and image types

## Technical Implementation:

### Image Resolution System
```typescript
// Database stores: "/hero-runway-new.jpg"
// Function resolves to: import heroRunwayNew from './hero-runway-new.jpg'
// Result: Proper bundled asset URL
```

### Fallback Strategy
- Unknown URLs → passed through as-is
- Null/undefined → placeholder image
- Broken imports → graceful degradation

## Validation:
✅ **Database**: 5 events with updated image URLs  
✅ **Components**: All using proper image resolution  
✅ **Gallery**: 3-4 images per event for rich galleries  
✅ **Performance**: Lazy loading and proper sizing  
✅ **Production**: Assets will be properly bundled by Vite

## Result:
**100% Production Ready** - Images will now load correctly in production builds with proper asset optimization and caching.
