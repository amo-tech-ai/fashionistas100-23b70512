## 🎨 Design Improvements

### Before (Tabbed Interface)
- Users had to click between 4 different tabs
- Information was siloed and disconnected
- No visual hierarchy or color coding
- Required mental mapping of where information lived

### After (Consolidated Dashboard)
- All information visible on one screen
- Smart visual organization with color coding
- Clear hierarchy guides the eye
- Intuitive layout reduces cognitive load
