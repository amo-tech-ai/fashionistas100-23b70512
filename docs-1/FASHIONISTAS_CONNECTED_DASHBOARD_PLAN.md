## 🛠️ Implementation Phases with Real Examples

### **Phase 1: Security & Foundation (Week 1-2)**

**Critical Fixes Based on Real Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Current Risk:** Profiles table publicly readable
   - **Impact:** Competitor scraped 1,200 model emails and sent spam job offers
   - **Fix:** Implement proper RLS policies
   
2. **Current Risk:** Payment data exposed
   - **Impact:** Stripe payment IDs visible, potential fraud risk
   - **Fix:** Restrict payments table to booking owner + service role

**Database Schema Enhancements:**
```sql
-- Create availability_slots for real-time conflict detection
CREATE TABLE availability_slots (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    resource_type text NOT NULL, -- 'venue', 'model', 'designer'
    resource_id uuid NOT NULL,
    start_datetime timestamptz NOT NULL,
    end_datetime timestamptz NOT NULL,
    status text DEFAULT 'available',
    event_id uuid REFERENCES events(id),
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Example: Block Teatro Metropolitano for Bogotá Fashion Week
INSERT INTO availability_slots (resource_type, resource_id, start_datetime, end_datetime, status, event_id)
VALUES 
  ('venue', 'teatro-metro-uuid', '2024-06-15 18:00:00+00', '2024-06-15 23:00:00+00', 'booked', 'runway-revolution-uuid');

-- Prevent double-booking: Check conflicts before confirming
SELECT * FROM availability_slots 
WHERE resource_type = 'venue' 
  AND resource_id = 'teatro-metro-uuid'
  AND status != 'available'
  AND (
    (start_datetime, end_datetime) OVERLAPS ('2024-06-15 18:00:00+00', '2024-06-15 23:00:00+00')
  );
```

### **Phase 2: Core Module Integration (Week 3-4)**

**Real-World Integration: Carolina Herrera Collection Launch**

**Scenario:**
Designer Carolina Herrera wants to showcase her new collection at Bogotá Fashion Week on June 15, 2024.

**Step-by-Step Integration:**

1. **Event Creation (Organizer Dashboard)**
   ```typescript
   const event = {
     title: "Carolina Herrera: Summer 2024 Collection",
     venue_id: "teatro-metropolitano-uuid",
     start_datetime: "2024-06-15T19:00:00Z",
     end_datetime: "2024-06-15T19:15:00Z",
     capacity: 1446,
     status: "published"
   };
   
   // System automatically:
   // 1. Checks venue availability ✅
   // 2. Blocks venue calendar for June 15, 7-7:15 PM
   // 3. Creates ticket inventory (1,446 seats)
   // 4. Notifies designer via WhatsApp
   ```

2. **Model Booking (Designer Dashboard)**
   ```typescript
   // Designer needs 15 models for 15-minute show
   const modelRequirements = {
     event_id: "carolina-show-uuid",
     models_needed: 15,
     required_measurements: { height: "175-185cm" },
     call_time: "2024-06-15T17:00:00Z", // 2 hours pre-show
     rate: 400000 // COP per model
   };
   
   // System automatically:
   // 1. Queries models matching measurements
   // 2. Filters by availability (June 15, 5-8 PM)
   // 3. Ranks by past performance, ratings
   // 4. Sends booking requests to top 20 models
   // 5. First 15 to accept are confirmed
   // 6. Auto-generates contracts
   // 7. Schedules payments: 50% upfront, 50% post-show
   ```

3. **Ticket Sales (Public Site + Bookings System)**
   ```typescript
   // María purchases 2 tickets
   const booking = {
     event_id: "carolina-show-uuid",
     ticket_tier: "general",
     quantity: 2,
     total_amount: 400000, // 200K x 2
     payment_method: "pse"
   };
   
   // Integration flow:
   // 1. Stripe processes PSE payment
   // 2. Webhook confirms payment success
   // 3. Generate 2 unique QR codes
   // 4. Send WhatsApp: "✅ Confirmed! Your QR codes:"
   // 5. Add to María's calendar
   // 6. Update event capacity: 1,444 seats remaining
   // 7. Trigger analytics: +2 tickets sold, +400K revenue
   ```

4. **Day-of Coordination (Calendar + Check-in)**
   ```typescript
   // Automated reminders
   // T-24 hours: WhatsApp to all attendees
   //   "Tomorrow! Carolina Herrera show at 7 PM. Doors open 6:30 PM."
   // T-2 hours: WhatsApp to models
   //   "Call time in 2 hours! Teatro Metropolitano, Stage Door entrance."
   // T-30 min: WhatsApp to designer
   //   "30 minutes to showtime! 14/15 models checked in."
   
   // Check-in system
   const checkIn = (qrCode: string) => {
     // Validate QR, mark attendance, assign seat
     // Real-time capacity update: 423 checked in / 1,446
   };
   ```

5. **Post-Event Analytics (Financials + Designer Dashboard)**
   ```typescript
   const eventMetrics = {
     attendance_rate: "97%", // 1,403 of 1,446 showed up
     revenue: {
       tickets: 85000000, // COP
       sponsors: 40000000,
       total: 125000000
     },
     designer_impact: {
       media_impressions: 2300000,
       instagram_growth: 15000, // new followers
       sales_leads: 87, // buyer inquiries
       wholesale_orders: 23 // boutique partnerships
     },
     model_performance: [
       { model_id: "valentina-uuid", runway_time: "14:02:30", rating: 5 },
       // ... 14 more
     ]
   };
   
   // Auto-generated reports sent to:
   // - Organizer: Financial summary, attendance stats
   // - Designer: Media reach, sales leads, model ratings
   // - Venue: Utilization report, damage assessment
   // - Sponsors: Impression metrics, engagement data
   ```

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)**

**AI-Powered Recommendations:**

**Example 1: Designer-Event Matching**
```typescript
// AI analyzes designer profile and suggests best-fit events
const designerProfile = {
  name: "Emerging Designer: Laura Jiménez",
  style: ["bohemian", "sustainable", "artisan"],
  price_range: "800K-2M COP",
  past_events: ["Medellín Eco Fashion", "Cartagena Craft Week"],
  social_following: 8500
};

// AI recommendation output:
const recommendedEvents = [
  {
    event: "Sustainable Fashion Summit Bogotá",
    match_score: 92,
    reasoning: "Style alignment (bohemian, sustainable), target audience matches price range, past eco-fashion event success",
    expected_roi: "280%",
    participation_fee: "3M COP",
    estimated_orders: "12-18 wholesale partnerships"
  },
  {
    event: "Colombia Artisan Showcase",
    match_score: 88,
    reasoning: "Artisan focus, emerging designer tier, strong social presence for event marketing",
    expected_roi: "240%"
  }
];
```

**Example 2: Dynamic Pricing Optimization**
```typescript
// AI adjusts ticket prices based on demand
const pricingAlgorithm = {
  base_price: 200000, // COP
  factors: {
    time_to_event: 45, // days
    sales_velocity: "18 tickets/day",
    designer_popularity: "high", // Carolina Herrera
    venue_capacity: 1446,
    current_sold: 423,
    competitor_pricing: [180000, 220000, 250000]
  }
};

// AI recommendation:
const optimizedPricing = {
  current_price: 200000,
  recommended_price: 235000, // +17.5%
  reasoning: "High demand (18 tix/day), only 29% sold with 45 days left, designer premium justifies increase",
  expected_impact: "+12% revenue, maintain 95% capacity target"
};

// Early-bird tier pricing:
const tieredPricing = [
  { tier: "early_bird", price: 160000, available: 200, ends: "30 days before" },
  { tier: "regular", price: 235000, available: 946, ends: "7 days before" },
  { tier: "last_minute", price: 280000, available: 300, ends: "day of event" }
];
```
