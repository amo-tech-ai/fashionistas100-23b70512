### ❌ EXCLUDED from MVP (Future Phases)

#### Deferred to Month 2-3
- **WhatsApp Business API Integration**
  - Reason: Requires 4-6 week approval process
  - Impact: Can use email confirmations for MVP
  - Timeline: Start approval process in Week 8

- **AI Content Generation**
  - Reason: Nice-to-have, not core value proposition
  - Impact: Organizers can write descriptions manually
  - Timeline: Month 3 (once OpenAI integration ready)

- **Advanced Venue Features**
  - Multi-room conflict resolution algorithm
  - Dynamic pricing engine
  - Equipment inventory tracking
  - Vendor coordination system
  - Reason: Complex, single-room MVP sufficient
  - Timeline: Month 4-5

- **Professional Services Marketplace**
  - Photography bookings
  - Video production
  - Model casting
  - Reason: Separate product, not core to events
  - Timeline: Month 6+

- **Spanish Translations**
  - Reason: English validates core functionality first
  - Impact: Colombian users are bilingual (80%+)
  - Timeline: Month 2 (after MVP validation)

#### Why These Exclusions Make Sense
- **Focus**: MVP must prove core value (10-min event creation + secure ticketing)
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks is realistic only with narrow scope
- **Resources**: Small team can't do everything at once
- **Validation**: Test core hypothesis before adding complexity

## 🔐 Security Requirements

### Authentication Security
- ✅ **Clerk JWT tokens** with 1-hour expiration
- ✅ **Refresh tokens** for seamless session persistence
- ✅ **MFA support** (optional for users, required for admins)
- ✅ **OAuth 2.0** for all social logins
- ✅ **Session monitoring**: Detect suspicious activity

### Database Security (RLS Policies)
```sql
-- Example: Events table
ALTER TABLE public.events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public can read published events
CREATE POLICY "events_public_read" ON public.events
  FOR SELECT
  USING (status = 'published');

-- Organizers can manage their own events
CREATE POLICY "events_organizer_manage" ON public.events
  FOR ALL
  USING (organizer_id = current_profile_id());

-- Admins can manage all events
CREATE POLICY "events_admin_manage" ON public.events
  FOR ALL
  USING (has_role('admin'));
```

**Critical RLS Checks**:
- ✅ All 41 tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ No direct access to `auth.users` table
- ✅ Service role key only in Edge Functions (server-side)
- ✅ Never expose service role key to client

### Payment Security
- ✅ **Stripe PCI compliance** (Level 1, no card data stored)
- ✅ **Webhook signature verification** (prevent replay attacks)
- ✅ **Idempotency keys** (prevent duplicate charges)
- ✅ **Audit logging** (immutable payment_audit_log table)
- ✅ **Encrypted connections** (TLS 1.3)

### Input Validation

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Stripe Webhook Failures
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (payments not confirmed, bookings stuck in pending)  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement webhook retry logic (Stripe retries up to 3 days)
- Manual reconciliation dashboard (admin can manually confirm payments)
- Alert system (Slack notification if webhook fails)
- Monitoring: Track webhook success rate in Posthog

#### Risk 2: Supabase RLS Policy Bugs
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Critical (data leaks, security breach)  
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive testing of all RLS policies (Week 7)
- Security audit by external consultant (Week 7)
- Penetration testing (try to access unauthorized data)
- Monitoring: Alert on any RLS policy violations

#### Risk 3: Performance Issues Under Load
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (slow page loads, poor UX)  
**Mitigation**:
- Load testing with k6 (simulate 100+ concurrent users)
- Database query optimization (add indexes, use explain analyze)
- CDN caching (Cloudinary for images, Vercel for static assets)
- Monitoring: Track p95 latency in Vercel Analytics

#### Risk 4: Mobile Payment Flow Issues
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (75% of users are mobile)  
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive mobile testing on real devices (iOS + Android)
- Stripe Checkout is mobile-optimized by default
- Test with slow 3G networks
- Monitoring: Track mobile conversion rate separately

### Business Risks

#### Risk 1: Low User Adoption
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (MVP fails to validate product-market fit)  
**Mitigation**:
- Beta testing with 15 users to validate UX (Week 7)
- User interviews to understand pain points
- Iterate quickly based on feedback
- Marketing campaign to drive awareness (Week 8)
- Early bird promotions to incentivize signups

#### Risk 2: Payment Processing Issues (PSE/Nequi)
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (Colombians prefer these methods over cards)  
**Mitigation**:
- Test extensively with Colombian test accounts
- Handle async payment confirmation (PSE takes 24-48h)
- Clear communication to users about payment status
- Alternative payment methods (card always available)
- Customer support for payment issues

#### Risk 3: Venue Partnership Delays
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium (fewer venue options for organizers)  
**Mitigation**:
- Manual venue entry by admin (Week 5-6)
- Gradual onboarding (5 venues for MVP)
- Direct outreach to Bogotá venues
- Incentivize with free 3-month listing

#### Risk 4: Competitive Pressure
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium (existing players like Eventbrite)  
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on fashion-specific niche (not general events)
- Colombian market focus (not global)
- Venue management as differentiator
- Speed of event creation (10 min vs 3 days)

### Operational Risks

#### Risk 1: Support Ticket Overload
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium (team can't keep up with requests)  
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive FAQ and help center (Week 7)
- In-app onboarding tooltips
- Video tutorials for common tasks
- Set expectations: 24-hour response time (not instant)
- Expand support team if tickets >20/week

#### Risk 2: Server Downtime
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: High (users can't access platform)  
**Mitigation**:
- Supabase has 99.9% SLA
- Vercel has 99.99% SLA
- Uptime monitoring (Pingdom or UptimeRobot)
- Status page (status.fashionos.co) to communicate outages
- Rollback plan if deployment causes issues

## 🎉 Conclusion

### What Makes This MVP Achievable

1. **Strong Foundation** (75% complete)
   - Authentication, database, and security already built
   - No need to "start from scratch"
   - 8 weeks is realistic for feature development

2. **Narrow Scope** (focus on core value)
   - Event creation + ticketing only
   - Deferred: WhatsApp, AI, services marketplace
   - Can expand post-MVP once validated

3. **Proven Tech Stack** (no experimental tech)
   - React, TypeScript, Supabase, Stripe
   - Mature, well-documented, reliable
   - Large communities for support

4. **Clear Success Metrics** (measurable goals)
   - 150 users, 20 events, 300 tickets
   - Objective, achievable, time-bound
   - Triggers re-evaluation if not met

### Why This MVP Will Succeed

1. **Real Pain Point** (validated through research)
   - 3-day → 10-minute event creation
   - Venue management chaos → streamlined
   - Colombian payment methods (PSE, Nequi)

2. **Underserved Market** (Colombian fashion)
   - Existing tools (Eventbrite) not fashion-specific
   - No venue management focus
   - No Colombian payment method support

3. **Compelling UX** (mobile-first, fast)
   - 6-stage wizard (simple, guided)
   - Auto-save (never lose progress)
   - Mobile-optimized (75%+ users)

4. **Revenue Model** (proven)
   - 10% ticket commission (Eventbrite uses 5-10%)
   - Venue booking fees ($50-200)
   - Immediate monetization (no growth-first)

### Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Approve MVP Scope** (Decision: Go/No-Go)
   - Review all sections of this document
   - Align team on priorities
   - Commit to 8-week timeline

2. **Kick Off Week 1** (Start: Monday)
   - Finalize auth testing
   - Set up wizard infrastructure
   - Create Vercel staging environment

3. **Weekly Standups** (Every Monday)
