**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-10-06

## üéØ Objectives Achieved

### 1. Event Health Scorer Agent ‚úÖ
- AI-powered event readiness assessment
- Multi-dimensional scoring system
- Real-time health monitoring
- Actionable recommendations and risk detection

### 2. Spanish i18n Framework üöß
- Foundation for internationalization (Next Phase)
- Colombian market localization preparation

## üìä Implementation Details

### Database Schema

**Table: `event_health_scores`**
```sql
- id, event_id, organization_id
- Scores (0-100): overall, ticket_sales, timeline, vendor_readiness, model_casting
- health_status: excellent | good | warning | critical
- ai_reasoning: text analysis
- recommendations: JSONB array
- risk_factors: JSONB array
- ai_model, confidence_score, timestamps
```

**RLS Policies:**
- Organizers can view scores for their events
- Admins can view all scores
- System can insert scores

**Indexes:**
- `event_id`, `organization_id`, `created_at DESC`, `health_status`
- Composite: `(event_id, created_at DESC)` for latest score queries

### Edge Function: `event-health-scorer`

**Endpoint**: `POST /functions/v1/event-health-scorer`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid"
}
```

**AI Model**: `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (via Lovable AI Gateway)

**Scoring Algorithm:**
1. **Ticket Sales Score** (0-100): Based on sold/total ratio
2. **Timeline Score** (0-100): Days until event vs preparation status
3. **Vendor Readiness Score** (0-100): Confirmed vendors / total vendors
4. **Model Casting Score** (0-100): Confirmed models / total models
5. **Overall Score**: Weighted average with AI adjustment

**Health Status Mapping:**
- 80-100: Excellent ‚úÖ
- 60-79: Good üëç
- 40-59: Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 0-39: Critical üö®

**Tool Calling:**
Uses OpenAI-compatible tool calling for structured output extraction with strict schema validation.

**Error Handling:**
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 402: AI credits exhausted
- Detailed logging to `ai_agent_logs` table

### Frontend Component: `EventHealthScorePanel`

**Features:**
- Visual health score display (0-100 scale)
- Status badge (excellent/good/warning/critical)
- Breakdown scores for 4 dimensions
- Progress bars for each metric
- AI reasoning explanation
- Actionable recommendations list
- Risk factors with alert styling
- Refresh/regenerate button
- Loading states

**UI Design:**
- Color-coded scores (green/blue/yellow/red)
- Responsive grid layout
- Card-based component structure
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Integration

**Event Detail Page:**
- New "Health Score" tab added
- Positioned between "AI Vendors" and "Bookings"
- Accessible to organizers and admins
- Auto-loads latest health score

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Generate Health Score
```bash
# Navigate to any event detail page
# Click "Health Score" tab
# Click "Generate Health Score" button
# Wait for AI analysis (2-5 seconds)
```

### 2. Verify Database Entry
```sql
SELECT * FROM event_health_scores
WHERE event_id = 'your-event-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. Check AI Logs
```sql
SELECT * FROM ai_agent_logs
WHERE agent_type = 'event_health_scorer'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Test Scenarios

**Scenario A: Healthy Event**
- 80%+ tickets sold
- 100% vendors confirmed
- 100% models confirmed
- 30+ days until event
- **Expected**: Excellent (80-100 score)

**Scenario B: At-Risk Event**
- <40% tickets sold
- <50% vendors confirmed
- <50% models confirmed
- <14 days until event
- **Expected**: Warning/Critical (0-59 score)
