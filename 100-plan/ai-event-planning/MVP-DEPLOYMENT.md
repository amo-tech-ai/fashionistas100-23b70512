## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Profile not found" when creating event
**Cause**: User not authenticated

**Cause**: Invalid event ID in URL  
**Fix**: Navigate from events list, don't manually type URLs

### Issue: AI functions show "Rate limit exceeded"
**Cause**: Too many requests in short time  
**Fix**: Wait 60 seconds and try again

### Issue: AI functions show "Credits exhausted"

4. Add payment processing
5. Scale to more users

**If users don't love it** (Pivot):
