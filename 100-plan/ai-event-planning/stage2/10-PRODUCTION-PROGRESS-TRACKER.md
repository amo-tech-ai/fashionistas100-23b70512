## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS LOG

### Week 2 Key Decisions

**Jan 14, 2025**: Decided to prioritize Event Health Scorer over Model Casting Agent due to higher impact on organizer dashboard.

**Jan 15, 2025**: Approved design for sponsor setup stage. Luis to implement by Jan 20.

**Jan 16, 2025**: Identified state persistence bug in wizard. María investigating, high priority fix.

**Jan 17, 2025**: Decided to use Lovable AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for all AI agents instead of multiple providers. Cost-effective and unified approach.

**Jan 18, 2025**: Team capacity concerns raised. Considering pushing advanced features (WhatsApp, i18n) to post-MVP release.

### Technical Decisions

- **State Management**: Using Zustand + localStorage for wizard state
- **AI Provider**: Lovable AI Gateway with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Real-time**: Supabase subscriptions for dashboard
- **Email**: SendGrid for transactional emails
- **Deployment**: Lovable Cloud auto-deploy on push

## 🎯 NEXT SPRINT PLANNING (Week 3: Jan 21-27)

### Top Priorities

1. **CRITICAL**: Complete Event Wizard (all 6 stages functional)
2. **CRITICAL**: Deploy Post-Publish Automation
3. **HIGH**: Complete Event Health Scorer with real data
4. **HIGH**: Finish all 9 dashboard cards with real-time updates
5. **MEDIUM**: Complete organizer and attendee journey testing
6. **MEDIUM**: Deploy Vendor Coordinator Agent
7. **LOW**: Start Model Casting Agent

### Sprint 3 Goals

- Event creation workflow 100% functional
- Dashboard completely live with real-time data
- At least 3 AI agents generating content
- Both user journeys tested and documented
- Zero critical blockers remaining

---

## 📞 STAKEHOLDER REPORT

### For Leadership

**Overall Status**: 🟡 **On Track but At Risk**

**What's Going Well**:
- Database architecture solid and production-ready
- Payment infrastructure complete
- Basic event creation working
- 4 dashboard cards showing real-time data

**What's Concerning**:
- AI agents taking longer than expected
- Event Wizard has state persistence bug
- Team capacity at 70% for key members
- 13 days to launch with 53% incomplete

**What We Need**:
- Consider extending timeline by 3-5 days for quality
- Approve scope reduction: move WhatsApp + i18n to post-MVP
- Additional QA resources for Week 4 testing

### For Product Team

**Feature Completion**:
- MVP Core: 50% (8/16 features done)
- AI Agents: 35% (2/5 agents functional)
- Dashboard: 44% (4/9 cards complete)
- User Journeys: 65% organizer, 70% attendee

**User Experience Gaps**:
- Post-publish automation not triggering
