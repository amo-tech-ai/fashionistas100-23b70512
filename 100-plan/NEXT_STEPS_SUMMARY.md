npm install @sentry/react @sentry/vite-plugin
```

**Configuration:**
```typescript
// src/main.tsx
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
  environment: import.meta.env.MODE,
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing(),
    new Sentry.Replay(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Sentry project created
- [ ] DSN configured as secret
- [ ] Test error captured
- [ ] Source maps uploaded
- [ ] Team alerts configured

---

### 3. 🟡 Manual Security Testing (RLS Validation)
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Verify security implementation

**Test Scenarios:**

#### Test 1: Profile PII Protection
```sql
-- As User A, try to access User B's profile
SELECT email, phone FROM profiles WHERE id = '<user-b-id>';
-- Expected: Permission denied or empty result

-- As User A, access own profile
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE clerk_id = '<user-a-clerk-id>';
-- Expected: Full profile data returned
```

#### Test 2: Payment Security
```sql
-- Try direct insert (should fail)
INSERT INTO payments (booking_id, amount_cents, currency)
VALUES ('<booking-id>', 10000, 'COP');
-- Expected: Permission denied

-- Try to update payment (should fail)
UPDATE payments SET status = 'succeeded' WHERE id = '<payment-id>';
-- Expected: Permission denied
```

#### Test 3: Booking Access Control
```sql
-- As User A, try to access User B's booking
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE profile_id = '<user-b-id>';
-- Expected: Empty result (own bookings only)

-- As organizer, view event bookings
SELECT b.* FROM bookings b
JOIN events e ON b.event_id = e.id
WHERE e.organizer_id = current_profile_id();
-- Expected: All bookings for organizer's events
```

#### Test 4: Role Escalation Prevention
```sql
-- Try to give yourself admin role
INSERT INTO user_roles (profile_id, role)
VALUES (current_profile_id(), 'admin');
-- Expected: Permission denied (admin-only operation)
```

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Profile PII protected
- [ ] Payments immutable
- [ ] Bookings owner-only
- [ ] Events organizer-restricted
- [ ] Role escalation blocked
- [ ] Admin functions restricted
- [ ] Public views show non-PII only

## 📝 NOTES

### Architecture Decisions
1. ✅ Separate user_roles table (prevents privilege escalation)
2. ✅ Security definer functions (safe RLS checks)
3. ✅ Webhook-only payment inserts (prevents fraud)
4. ✅ Immutable payments (audit trail)
5. ✅ Security invoker views (respect RLS)

### Best Practices Applied
- All database functions use `search_path = 'public'`
- All sensitive operations use security definer functions
- All tables have appropriate RLS policies
- All views respect RLS (security_invoker = on)
- PII explicitly protected (owner-or-admin only)

### Common Pitfalls Avoided
- ❌ Roles stored on user profile (privilege escalation)
- ❌ Functions without search_path (security vulnerability)
- ❌ Views with security_definer (bypass RLS)
- ❌ Public PII exposure (data leak)
- ❌ Direct payment inserts (fraud risk)
